rrdtool (1.4.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sebastian Harl ]
  * Ack NMUs; thanks to Jonathan Wiltshire and gregor herrmann!
  * Added debian/patches/bts664724-rrdcached-j-segfault:
    Fixed segfault in rrdcached when starting without having the journal
    directory available: canonicalize the journal path after creating the
    directory; else, realpath(3) will return NULL causing strdup() to
    segfault. Also, check the return value of realpath(3) before further using
    it. Thanks to Helmut Grohne for reporting this (Closes: #664724).

  [ Bernd Zeimetz ]
  * Removed a restriction on the tcl-dev build-dep which was an accidental
    left over from a test-build against a new tcl version. Build-depend on
    tcl-dev >= 8 && <= 9 rather than >= 8.5. The tcl bindings support any 8.x
    version. This makes backporting easier.

  [ Sebastian Harl ]
  * New upstream SVN snapshot based on trunk at revision 1930.

  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on gettext instead of intltool following the switch made by

      6.2.2).
    - Let rrdtool-dbg recommend liblua5.1-rrd0.

      not cleaned up by any Makefile.
    - Use DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU instead of DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE to check for the

    - Set examples/rrdcached/RRDCached.pm's file mode to 0644.

    - Fixed pathname used in rrdgraph's --imginfo output (Closes: #497739).
  * debian/patches:

      version of rrdtool; use rrd_free2() instead of rrd_free() to not leak
      memory.
    - Updated no-rpath-for-perl to apply to the latest version of rrdtool.
    - Removed bts493553-pango-utf-8 - included upstream.
    - Removed bts496847-error-handling - included upstream.

    - Added compiler-warning-fixes - upstream patch to fix some compiler

  * debian/rules:
    - Remove src/librrd.sym in the clean target - this file is automatically
      created during the build but not cleaned up in the upstream Makefiles.
    - Remove .txt and .pod documentation from the 'rrdtool' binary package -
      the manpages are a lot more useful.
    - Pass --fail-missing (instead of --list-missing) to dh_install.
    - Use 'pyversions -vr' instead of 'pysupport-parseversions'.
  * Added new binary package rrdtool-dbg. Unfortunately, segfaults and the

    - Install examples/* and ifOctets.tcl using dh_install instead of
      dh_installexamples. This allows the use of --fail-missing when running
      dh_install.
  * Removed debian/pyversions - has been replaced by the XS-Python-Version
    field.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Sep 2001 13:13:22 -0400

rrdtool (1.0.33-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship with pre-generated files from autoconf2.50/automake, rather than
    pulling them in at build-time, in order to work around the current
    libtool mess.  This makes the diff less manageable, but should make
    the build more stable.
  * debian/control: remove build-dependencies on autoconf/automake/libtool
  * debian/rules: don't call autoconf/automake
  * Fix shlibs file (it was trying to use a substitution)
  * configure.in: remove makefiles that no longer exist from AC_OUTPUT.
    Apparently this is an error in autoconf 2.50.

    let libtool do the right thing.

rrdtool (1.0.27-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Updated for new Perl policy

    prevents
  * debian/rules: Don't call dh_suidregister; we didn't use it anyway
  * debian/control: Build-depend on the new debhelper for dh_perl
  * debian/control: rrdtool-tcl only seems to work with 8.0, so depend on
    tcl8.0
  * debian/control: Build-depend on perl 5.6.0+
  * debian/librrd?-perl: Updated for new Perl filesystem layout

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Feb 2001 19:04:11 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Handle DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS debug, nostrip

  * debian/rules: Miscellaneous cleanup
  * Recompile librrds-perl against perl-5.6

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 21:23:55 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix Build-Depends to reflect our dependency on dpkg-dev >= 1.7.0 |
    librrd0.  The old dpkg can only calculate our dependencies correctly
    if the runtime library is installed on the system, so potato users
    must either install the potato librrd0 or the new dpkg-dev
    (Closes: #77479)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Nov 2000 20:39:55 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to comply with policy 3.2.1.0:
    - Don't build with -g by default
  * Build-Depend on tcl8.0-dev (not tcl-dev), since that is the only
    version we currently work with.
  * Added automake to Build-Depends (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 22:29:02 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Big packaging cleanup release.
  * Fixed perl module compilation to link with the shared library, rather
    than including a copy of the static library inside the .so (also fixes
    a lintian error, shlib-with-non-pic-code in librrds-perl)
  * Fixed tcl module compilation to link with the shared library, rather
    than including a copy of the static library inside the .so (also fixes
    a lintian error, shlib-with-non-pic-code in rrdtool-tcl)
  * The above shrunk the size of the perl and tcl library packages from
    60k each to about 20k (perl) and 16k (tcl)
  * We can now use shlibdeps to calculate the dependencies for
    librrds-perl, so those will be more correct now
  * Rather than include Makefile.in changes in the .diff.gz, just keep our
    modifications to Makefile.am and run automake in debian/rules.  This
    makes the .diff.gz much smaller and cleaner
  * Fixed shared library dependencies all around to be smarter
  * rrdtool package now Suggests librrds-perl (rather than depending on
    perl), as it is only needed for an auxiliary script for converting
    mrtg data
