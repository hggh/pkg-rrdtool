       rrdbuild - Instructions for building RRDtool

       If you downloaded the source of rrdtool you have to compile it. This
       document will give some information on how this is done.

       RRDtool relies on services of thrid part libraries. Some of these
       libraries may already be installed on your system. You have to compile
       copies of the other ones before you can build RRDtool.

       This document will tell you about all the necessary steps to get going.

       BBuuiillddiinngg

       Before you start to build RRDtool, you have to decide two things:

       1.  In which directory you want to build the software.

       2.  Where you want to install the software.

       Once you have decided. Save the two locations into environment vari-
       ables.  Depending on the shell you are using, you can do either
       (bash,zsh):

        BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rrdbuild
        INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/rrdtool-1.2.28

       Or if you run tcsh:

        set BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rrdbuild
        set INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/rrdtool-1.2.28

       If your _/_t_m_p is mounted with the option noexec (RHEL seems todo that)
       you have to choose a different directory!

       Now make sure the BUILD_DIR exists and go there:

        mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR
        cd $BUILD_DIR

       Lets first assume you already have all the necessary libraries
       pre-installed. Note that these instructions assume that your copies of
       ttaarr and mmaakkee are actually GGNNUU ttaarr and GGNNUU mmaakkee respectively. It could
       be that they are installed as ggttaarr and ggmmaakkee on your system.

        wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/rrdtool-1.2.28.tar.gz
        tar zxf rrdtool-1.2.28.tar.gz
        cd rrdtool-1.2.28
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR && make && make install

       Ok, this was very optimistic. This try will probably have ended with
       ccoonnffiigguurree complaining about several missing libraries. If you are on a
       Linux or *bsd system you may want to just install the missing bits from
       your software repository. When you do that, make sure you also get the
       --ddeevv package for each library you install. Once you have the missing
       bits on board, just re-run the last line of the instructions above.

       But again this may have been too optimistic, and you actually have to
       compile your own copies of the required libraries.

       _B_u_i_l_d _T_i_p_p_s _f_o_r _A_I_X

       If you are woking with AIX, you may find the the ----ddiissaabbllee--sshhaarreedd
       option will cause things to break for you. In that case you may have to
       install the shared libraries into the rrdtool PREFIX and work with
       ----ddiissaabbllee--ssttaattiicc instead.

       Another hint to get rrdtool working on AIX is to use the IBM XL C Com-
       piler:

        export CC=/usr/vac/bin/cc
        export PERLCC=$CC

       (Better instructions for AIX welcome!)

       In order to build the libraries you need a compiler on your system.
       Unfortunately compilers are not all alike. This has an effect on the
       CFLAGS you want to set. The examples below are for the popular GCC com-
       piler suite.  If you have an other compile you have to use the follow-
       ing settings:

       Sun Forte
            CFLAGS="-xO3 -kPIC"

       Building zlib
            cd $BUILD_DIR
            wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
            tar  zxf zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
            cd zlib-1.2.3
            env CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" ./configure --prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
            make
            make install

       Building libpng
           Libpng itself requires zlib to build, so we need to help a bit. If
           you already have a copy of zlib on your system (which is very lik-
           ley) you can drop the settings of LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS. Note that
           the backslash (\) at the end of line 4 means that line 4 and line 5
           are on one line.

            cd $BUILD_DIR
            wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libpng-1.2.10.tar.gz
            tar zxvf libpng-1.2.10.tar.gz
            cd libpng-1.2.10
            env CPPFLAGS="-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include" LDFLAGS="-L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib" CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" \
                ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
            make
            make install

       Building freetype
            cd $BUILD_DIR
            wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/freetype-2.1.10.tar.bz2
            tar jxvf freetype-2.1.10.tar.bz2
            cd freetype-2.1.10
            env CPPFLAGS="-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include" LDFLAGS="-L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib" CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" \
                ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
            make
            make install

           If you run into problems building freetype on Solaris, you may want
           to try to add the following at the end of the configure line:

            GNUMAKE=gmake EGREP=egrep

       Building libart_lgpl
            cd $BUILD_DIR
            wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libart_lgpl-2.3.17.tar.gz
            tar zxvf libart_lgpl-2.3.17.tar.gz
            cd libart_lgpl-2.3.17
            env CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
            make
            make install

       Now all the dependent libraries are built and you can try again. Since
       these are static libraries, you may have to use _r_a_n_l_i_b to make them
       accessible.  Especially BSD systems like Mac OS X may require this,
       Linux and Solaris will do just fine without since their _a_r command does
       ranlibs job as well.

        ranlib $BUILD_DIR/lb/lib/*.a

       This time you tell configure where it should be looking for libraries
       and include files. This is done via environment variables. Depending on
       the shell you are running, the syntax for setting environment variables
       is different. Under csh/tcsh you use:

        set IR=-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include
        setenv CPPFLAGS "$IR $IR/libart-2.0 $IR/freetype2 $IR/libpng"
        setenv LDFLAGS  -L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib
        setenv CFLAGS -O3

       If you are running bash/sh/ash/ksh/zsh use this:

        IR=-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include
        CPPFLAGS="$IR $IR/libart-2.0 $IR/freetype2 $IR/libpng"
        LDFLAGS="-L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib"
        CFLAGS=-O3
        export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS CFLAGS

       And finally try building again. We disable the python and tcl bindings
       because it seems that a fair number of people have ill configured
       python and tcl setups that would prevent rrdtool from building if they
       are included in their current state.

        cd $BUILD_DIR/rrdtool-1.2.28
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR --disable-python --disable-tcl
        make clean
        make
        make install

       SOLARIS HINT: if you want to build  the perl module for the native perl
       (the one shipping with solaris) you will need the sun forte compiler
       installed on your box or you have to hand-tune bind-
       ings/perl-shared/Makefile while building!

       Now go to _$_I_N_S_T_A_L_L___D_I_R//sshhaarree//rrrrddttooooll//eexxaammpplleess// and run them to see if
       your build has been successful.
