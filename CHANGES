	* branches/1.3/program/configure.ac,
	  branches/1.3/program/src/rrd_thread_safe.c: Even though POSIX/XSI
	  requires "strerror_r" to return an "int", some systems (e.g. the
	  GNU libc) return a "char *" _and_ ignore the second argument (user
	  provided buffer). The configure script now checks for that
	  behavior using AC_FUNC_STRERROR_R. rrd_strerror() in
	  rrd_thread_safe.c has been updated to (hopefully) handle all
	  possible cases. Previously, rrd_strerror() would have returned
	  "strerror_r failed. sorry!" in mostly any cases when using glibc,
	  since "if (strerror_r())" had been used to check for errors which
	  evaluates to true if a (non-NULL) pointer was returned. Now, we,
	  at least, return the error number in case anything else fails.
	  Thanks to Alessandro Iurlano for reporting this issue after
	  spotting it in collectd <http://collectd.org>. patch by Sebastian
